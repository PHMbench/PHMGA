## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PHMbench/PHMGA.git
cd PHMGA

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv tutorial_env
source tutorial_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: tutorial_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install jupyter notebook  # For interactive tutorials
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required for LLM-enhanced tutorials
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: Disable LangSmith for cleaner logs
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=false
```

### Verify Installation

```python
# Run this in Python to verify setup
from src.tools.signal_processing_schemas import OP_REGISTRY
print(f"Available operators: {len(OP_REGISTRY)}")

# Should output: Available operators: 30+ (depending on implementation)
```
