## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PHMbench/PHMGA.git
cd PHMGA

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv tutorial_env
source tutorial_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: tutorial_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install jupyter notebook  # For interactive tutorials
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Multi-LLM Provider Support (at least one required)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_tongyi_api_key_here  # Optional: ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ
ZHIPUAI_API_KEY=your_zhipu_api_key_here     # Optional: Êô∫Ë∞±GLM

# LLM Configuration
LLM_PROVIDER=google  # or openai, tongyi, zhipu
LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro  # or gpt-4o, qwen-max, glm-4

# Optional: Disable LangSmith for cleaner logs
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=false
```

### Verify Installation

```python
# Run this in Python to verify setup
from src.tools.signal_processing_schemas import OP_REGISTRY
from src.model import get_llm
from src.utils import initialize_state

print(f"Available signal processing operators: {len(OP_REGISTRY)}")
print(f"LLM provider configured: {get_llm()}")
print("‚úÖ PHMGA Graph Agent system ready!")

# Should output: Available operators: 60+ (depending on implementation)
