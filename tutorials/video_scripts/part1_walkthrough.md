### Introduction (5 minutes)

**[SCENE: Welcome screen with PHMGA logo]**

**Narrator**: "Welcome to the PHMGA Tutorial Series! I'm [Name], and today we're diving into Part 1: Foundation - Basic Function Implementation. By the end of this video, you'll understand genetic algorithms, implement both traditional and LLM-enhanced versions, and see how they compare in real-world optimization problems."

**[SCENE: Agenda slide]**

"Here's what we'll cover today:
1. Understanding genetic algorithms and optimization
2. Implementing a traditional genetic algorithm from scratch
3. Enhancing it with LLM capabilities
4. Comparing performance and analyzing results
5. Hands-on exercises you can try yourself"

**[SCENE: Prerequisites check]**

"Before we start, make sure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- The PHMGA repository cloned locally
- About an hour of focused time"

### Section 1: Understanding the Problem (8 minutes)

**[SCENE: Switch to code editor showing problem setup]**

**Narrator**: "Let's start with a simple optimization problem. We want to minimize this quadratic function: f(x, y) = (x - 3)² + (y + 1)² + 5"

**[LIVE CODING: Create visualization]**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def quadratic_function(x, y):
    return (x - 3)**2 + (y + 1)**2 + 5

# Create 3D visualization
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
y = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = quadratic_function(X, Y)

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121, projection='3d')
ax1.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.8)
ax1.scatter([3], [-1], [5], color='red', s=100)
ax1.set_title('3D Surface Plot')
```

**Narrator**: "As you can see, this function has a clear global minimum at x=3, y=-1 with a value of 5. The red dot shows our target. Now, how can genetic algorithms help us find this optimum?"

**[SCENE: Genetic algorithm concepts animation]**

"Genetic algorithms are inspired by natural evolution. They work with:
- A population of candidate solutions
- Fitness evaluation to measure solution quality
- Selection of the best individuals for reproduction
- Crossover to combine parent solutions
- Mutation to introduce variation
- Evolution over multiple generations"

### Section 2: Traditional Implementation (15 minutes)

**[SCENE: Open traditional_ga.py file]**

**Narrator**: "Let's implement a genetic algorithm from scratch. We'll start with the Individual class that represents a candidate solution."

**[LIVE CODING: Walk through Individual class]**

```python
class Individual:
    def __init__(self, genes=None, bounds=(-10.0, 10.0)):
        if genes is None:
            self.genes = [random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1]) for _ in range(2)]
        else:
            self.genes = genes.copy()
        self.fitness = None
        self.bounds = bounds
    
    def evaluate_fitness(self):
        x, y = self.genes
        objective_value = (x - 3)**2 + (y + 1)**2 + 5
        self.fitness = -objective_value  # Negative for maximization
        return self.fitness
```

**Narrator**: "Notice how we use negative fitness for maximization. This is a common pattern in genetic algorithms."

**[LIVE CODING: Demonstrate mutation]**

```python
def mutate(self, mutation_rate):
    for i in range(len(self.genes)):
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            mutation = random.gauss(0, 0.5)
            self.genes[i] += mutation
            # Ensure bounds are respected
            self.genes[i] = max(self.bounds[0], min(self.bounds[1], self.genes[i]))
```

**Narrator**: "Mutation adds random variation. We use Gaussian noise and ensure genes stay within bounds."

**[LIVE CODING: Show crossover operation]**

```python
def crossover(self, other, crossover_rate):
    if random.random() > crossover_rate:
        return Individual(self.genes, self.bounds), Individual(other.genes, self.bounds)
    
    # Uniform crossover
    child1_genes = []
    child2_genes = []
    
    for i in range(len(self.genes)):
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            child1_genes.append(self.genes[i])
            child2_genes.append(other.genes[i])
        else:
            child1_genes.append(other.genes[i])
            child2_genes.append(self.genes[i])
    
    return Individual(child1_genes, self.bounds), Individual(child2_genes, self.bounds)
```

**[LIVE CODING: Walk through main GA class]**

**Narrator**: "Now let's see the main genetic algorithm class. The key method is evolve_generation..."

**[Show evolution loop and explain each step]**

**[LIVE CODING: Run the algorithm]**

```python
config = GAConfig(
    population_size=50,
    mutation_rate=0.1,
    crossover_rate=0.8,
    max_generations=100
)

ga = TraditionalGA(config)
results = ga.run(verbose=True)
```

**Narrator**: "Watch how the algorithm converges. You can see the fitness improving over generations..."

### Section 3: LLM Enhancement (12 minutes)

**[SCENE: Open llm_enhanced_ga.py]**

**Narrator**: "Now let's see how we can enhance our genetic algorithm with Large Language Model capabilities. The LLM can help with parameter tuning and provide insights."

**[LIVE CODING: Show LLM interface]**

```python
class LLMInterface:
    def generate_response(self, prompt, max_tokens=150):
        # In practice, this would call OpenAI API
        # For demo, we'll use mock responses
        pass

class LLMEnhancedGA:
    def __init__(self, ga_config, llm_config):
        self.ga_config = ga_config
        self.llm_config = llm_config
        self.llm = self._initialize_llm()
```

**[LIVE CODING: Show adaptive parameter tuning]**

```python
def adaptive_parameter_tuning(self):
    if self.generation % 25 != 0:
        return
    
    current_performance = {
        'generation': self.generation,
        'best_fitness': self.best_individual.fitness,
        'diversity': self._calculate_diversity()
    }
    
    suggestions = self.get_parameter_tuning_suggestions(current_performance)
    
    # Parse and apply suggestions
    if "increase mutation" in suggestions.lower():
        self.ga_config.mutation_rate = min(0.5, self.ga_config.mutation_rate * 1.2)
```

**Narrator**: "The LLM analyzes current performance and suggests parameter adjustments. This can help the algorithm adapt to different problem characteristics."

**[LIVE CODING: Run LLM-enhanced version]**

```python
llm_config = LLMConfig(
    provider="mock",
    enable_parameter_tuning=True,
    enable_fitness_analysis=True
)

llm_ga = LLMEnhancedGA(ga_config, llm_config)
llm_results = llm_ga.run(verbose=True)
```

**Narrator**: "Notice how the LLM provides analysis and suggestions throughout the evolution process."

### Section 4: Performance Comparison (10 minutes)

**[SCENE: Open benchmark_comparison.py]**

**Narrator**: "Let's compare both implementations using our comprehensive benchmarking suite."

**[LIVE CODING: Run benchmarks]**

```python
from benchmark_comparison import BenchmarkSuite, BenchmarkConfig

config = BenchmarkConfig(
    num_runs=10,
    max_generations=100,
    population_sizes=[30, 50, 100],
    mutation_rates=[0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
)

benchmark = BenchmarkSuite(config)
results = benchmark.run_comprehensive_benchmark()
```

**[SCENE: Show results visualization]**

**Narrator**: "The benchmarking suite provides detailed analysis including:
- Convergence comparison between implementations
- Parameter sensitivity analysis
- Resource usage metrics
- Success rates and reliability scores"

**[Walk through generated plots and explain insights]**

"As we can see from the results:
1. Both implementations find good solutions
2. LLM enhancement can provide adaptive benefits
3. Parameter tuning significantly affects performance
4. The trade-off between computational cost and solution quality"

### Section 5: Hands-on Exercises (8 minutes)

**[SCENE: Open exercises.py]**

**Narrator**: "Now it's your turn! Let's look at the hands-on exercises you can try."

**[LIVE CODING: Show Rosenbrock function exercise]**

```python
def exercise_1_rosenbrock():
    def rosenbrock_fitness(genes):
        x, y = genes
        a, b = 1, 100
        objective = (a - x)**2 + b * (y - x**2)**2
        return -objective
    
    exercise = ExerciseFramework("Rosenbrock Function Optimization")
    results = exercise.run_exercise(
        fitness_function=rosenbrock_fitness,
        bounds=(-5.0, 5.0),
        expected_solution=[1.0, 1.0]
    )
```

**Narrator**: "The Rosenbrock function is more challenging than our quadratic example. It has a narrow valley leading to the global optimum."

**[Show other exercises briefly]**

"Other exercises include:
- Multi-dimensional sphere function
- Multi-modal Rastrigin function
- Custom function design challenge
