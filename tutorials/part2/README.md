# Part 2: Core Components Architecture

**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Completion of Part 1, basic understanding of graph theory  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand the PHMGA core architectural components
2. Implement a Router Component for workflow orchestration
3. Create a Graph Component for population structures and relationships
4. Design a State Management system with persistence and thread safety
5. Master integration patterns for combining components effectively
6. Build production-ready, modular components

## 📋 Overview

This tutorial focuses on the three core architectural components that form the backbone of the PHMGA framework:

1. **Router Component**: Manages request routing and workflow orchestration
2. **Graph Component**: Handles population structures, relationships, and graph algorithms
3. **State Management**: Provides persistence, thread safety, and state validation

Each component is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Can be used independently or combined
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features and capabilities
- **Production-ready**: Includes error handling, logging, and monitoring
- **Well-tested**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
