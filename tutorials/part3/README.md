# Part 3: Advanced Integration and Real-World Applications

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Completion of Parts 1-2, signal processing basics  
**Difficulty**: Advanced

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

1. Build enhanced Case 1 implementation using unified PHMGA architecture
2. Create autonomous signal processing DAGs with self-optimization
3. Deploy production-ready systems with monitoring and scaling
4. Develop custom operators for domain-specific applications
5. Implement real-time processing pipelines
6. Master advanced integration patterns and best practices

## 📋 Overview

This advanced tutorial demonstrates the full power of the PHMGA framework through two comprehensive case studies:

### Case 1: Enhanced System Integration
Building upon the existing bearing fault diagnosis case, we'll create a unified architecture that combines:
- Router Component for workflow orchestration
- Graph Component for population management
- State Management for persistence and recovery
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Production deployment configurations

### Case 2: Autonomous Signal Processing DAG
A self-optimizing signal processing pipeline that:
- Automatically discovers optimal processing sequences
- Adapts to different signal characteristics
- Supports multiple signal types (time-series, frequency domain, spectrograms)
- Provides generalization framework for new domains
