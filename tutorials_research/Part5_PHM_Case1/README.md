# Part 5: PHM Case Study - Complete Bearing Fault Diagnosis System

## Overview

This final tutorial integrates **all concepts from Parts 1-4** into a complete **Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)** system using the PHMGA architecture. We demonstrate real-world bearing fault diagnosis combining multi-provider LLMs, multi-agent systems, reflection-based research, and DAG-based signal processing.

## Learning Objectives

By completing Part 5, you will understand:

1. **System Integration**: How all tutorial components work together in production
2. **PHMGA Architecture**: Complete understanding of the PHM Graph Agent system
3. **Real-World Application**: Bearing fault diagnosis using actual signal processing
4. **Research-to-Production**: Bridging academic research and industrial deployment
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive system assessment and validation

## Case Study: Bearing Fault Diagnosis

**Industrial Scenario**: You're developing an AI system for a **manufacturing facility** that needs to:
- Monitor rotating machinery health in real-time
- Detect bearing faults before catastrophic failure
- Provide actionable maintenance recommendations
- Generate research reports for continuous improvement

This system combines:
- **Research capabilities** (Parts 1-3) for literature analysis and knowledge updates
- **DAG processing** (Part 4) for efficient signal analysis pipelines
- **Production deployment** with real-time performance requirements

## Quick Start

```python
# Import the complete PHMGA system
from modules.phmga_system import PHMGASystem
from modules.production_config import ProductionConfig

# Create production-ready configuration
config = ProductionConfig.for_bearing_diagnosis()

# Initialize complete system
phmga = PHMGASystem(config)

# Run case study
results = phmga.run_case_study("case1_bearing_faults")
