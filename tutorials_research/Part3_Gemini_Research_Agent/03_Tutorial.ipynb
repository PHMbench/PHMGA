    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to build an **intelligent research agent** that uses **reflection loops** to conduct comprehensive research on academic topics. We'll adapt Google's Gemini research pattern to work with **any LLM provider** from Part 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:\n",
    "1. **Reflection-based research**: How agents can evaluate their own work and iterate\n",
    "2. **Multi-step workflows**: Building complex research pipelines with LangGraph\n",
    "3. **Knowledge gap identification**: Teaching agents to recognize what they don't know\n",
    "4. **Dynamic query generation**: Creating targeted search strategies\n",
    "5. **Research synthesis**: Combining multiple sources into coherent insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Academic Research Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: You're writing a literature review section for your paper and need to research: *\"What are the recent advances in quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computing?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually searching and synthesizing papers, we'll build an agent that:\n",
    "- Generates diverse search queries\n",
    "- Conducts parallel web searches\n",
    "- Reflects on research completeness\n",
    "- Identifies knowledge gaps\n",
    "- Iteratively improves research coverage\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Custom Research Domain\n",
    "Modify the `query_generator.py` to add a new domain pattern for your research area (e.g., \"materials_science\", \"biomedical_engineering\"). Test with domain-specific research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Advanced Reflection Criteria\n",
    "Extend the `reflection_agent.py` to include:\n",
    "- Source recency requirements (e.g., only papers from last 2 years)\n",
    "- Citation count thresholds for credibility\n",
    "- Geographic diversity of research sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Multi-Language Research\n",
    "Adapt the system to conduct research in multiple languages by:\n",
    "- Generating queries in different languages\n",
    "- Using translation APIs for source processing\n",
    "- Implementing cross-language result synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4: Research Workflow Optimization\n",
    "Implement performance optimizations:\n",
    "- Caching of search results to avoid redundant API calls\n",
    "- Async/await patterns for truly parallel processing\n",
    "- Result ranking and filtering strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5: Integration with Academic Databases\n",
    "Extend the web searcher to integrate with:\n",
    "- ArXiv API for preprints\n",
    "- PubMed for biomedical literature\n",
    "- IEEE Xplore for engineering papers\n",
