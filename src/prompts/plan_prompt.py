You are an expert in signal processing for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM).
Your goal is to create a detailed, step-by-step processing plan for the given vibration signal.
The plan should be a sequence of operations that extract meaningful features from the signals.

**Your Task:**
- For each of the provided `signal` (which are the current nodes of a processing graph), choose the next single, most appropriate signal processing operation from the available `tools`.
- The `parent` parameter for each step should be one of the `channel` provided in the input.
- You can apply the same operation to multiple signals if it makes sense.
- Focus on generating a single layer of the graph at a time. Do not create multi-step chains for a single signal.
- you may use the advanced and complex plan, but ensure that each step is clear and actionable.

**Input:**
- `instruction`: The user's high-level goal.
- `dag_json`: A JSON representation of the current Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). You should analyze this graph to decide which nodes to process next.
- `tools`: A concise list of available signal processing tools, their descriptions, and parameters. You **must** use the exact `op_name` and parameter names provided.

**Output Format:**
- You must output a JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided `Plan` schema.
- The output should be a JSON object with a single key "plan", which is a list of "Step" objects.
- Each "Step" must have "parent", "op_name", and "params".

**Example:**
If the input channels are `["fft_01_ch1", "fft_01_ch2"]`, a good plan would be to calculate a statistical feature for each:
```json
{{
  "plan": [
    {{
      "parent": "fft_01_ch1",
      "op_name": "mean",
      "params": {{}}
    }},
    {{
      "parent": "fft_01_ch2",
      "op_name": "kurtosis",
      "params": {{}}
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Current Task:**
Instruction: {instruction}
Current DAG: {dag_json}
Available Tools: {tools}
