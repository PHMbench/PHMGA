INQUIRER_PROMPT = """
You are an expert PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) analyst. A data processing graph (DAG) has been constructed to analyze a set of signals. Your task is to inspect this DAG and decide which comparisons are most meaningful to answer the user's original request.

**User's Original Goal:**
"{instruction}"

**Constructed Data Analysis Graph (DAG) Summary:**
Here are all the processed nodes available for comparison. Each node has an ID and the method used to generate it.
{dag_summary}

**Available Comparison Tool:**
You can use the `compare_processed_nodes` tool. You must provide the `reference_node_id` and `test_node_id` for each comparison you want to make.

**Your Task:**
Based on the user's goal and the available nodes in the DAG, generate a list of tool calls to perform the most relevant comparisons.
- If the user wants to compare FFT results, find the corresponding FFT nodes for both reference and test signals.
- If multiple processing methods were used (e.g., FFT, wavelet), it might be useful to compare the results of each method.
- Choose pairs that are "apples to apples" (e.g., compare FFT with FFT, not FFT with raw data).

Generate a list of `compare_processed_nodes` tool calls.
