# PHMGA

This repository contains a prototype implementation of a Predictive Health Management (PHM)
system using LangGraph. The code defines a small set of self-describing operators
and demonstrates how they can be executed in a graph-based pipeline.

See [docs/TUTORIAL.md](docs/TUTORIAL.md) for a quick walkthrough of the demo
pipeline.
